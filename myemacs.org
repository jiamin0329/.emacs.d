*** General
**** theme 
     GUI mode - using doom-themes
     Terminal mode - not decided, font/color/background should be repicked
**** mode line
     Powerline package is used, see lisp/init-general.el.
**** ace-window
     ace-window is used to switch from window to window.
**** swiper
     use swiper to do the searching




*** C/C++ support
***** Semantic 
      Now Semantic can search system include path and current path, but it still cannot access all includes in local project. So sometimes auto-complete cannot work. 
***** helm-gtags
      gtags works well. I can enjoy code navigation.

*** Projectile
    Here projectile is integrated in helm. 

    Keybindings:(with C-c p prefix)
    C-c p f - helm-projectile-find-file-dwin
